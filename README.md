#Django Project Tutorial INTRO

- Django version 3.1.4
- Python 3.7.4

Writing your first Django app to learn.

This is an offical Django project from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/

I made some changes as the original code was not working from out of box.

This is a walk through to create a basic poll application.

Itâ€™ll consist of two parts:

    -A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
    -An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
